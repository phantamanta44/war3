Contributing to the Mod
========

Via Issues
-----
Issues can be submitted through tickets. Before making a ticket, consider the following:
* Has the issue already been addressed in a previous ticket?
* Are you using the latest version of the mod?
* Has the developer specifically stated the feature is WIP or non-usable?
* Are you able to reproduce the issue after restarting your game?
* Is it actually an issue, and not a feature you don't like?

If you still think it's appropriate to make a ticket, please stick to these guidelines so the issue can be addressed in an efficient and orderly manner:
* Provide a brief, but detailed overview of the issue.
* Provide a **full** crashlog, if one exists.
* Provide screenshots for visual glitches.
* List other mods you're loading alongside the War3 client.
* Use proper grammar, spelling, and terminology.
* Keep some level of coherency in your sentence structure.
The issue tracker can be found [here](https://github.com/phantamanta44/war3/issues).

Via P/R's
-----
Pull requests are encouraged, **provided you know what you're doing**. If you don't, just skip this section.

All pull requests must stick to these guidelines, or they **WILL** be rejected.
* Use proper syntax and formatting consistent with the rest of the code.
* Include appropriate licensing information if third-party material is used.
* Please test your code before you submit a P/R. It's not my job :v
